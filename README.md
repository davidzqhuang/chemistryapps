This is a template application for developing and publishing a set of applets.

Features:
- Bare bones
- Password protected
- Simple styling

This is based on the boilerplate `create-next-app`.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start making apps by modifying `src/app/[calculator, applet2]/page.tsx`
